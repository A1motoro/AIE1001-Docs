Outline
•Compiler vs Interpreter
•Interactive and Script Mode 
•Variable, Constant, Reserved words
•Data Types: Integer, Float, String
•Functions: print(), int(),  float(), str(), type()
•Call Expression and Nested Call Expression
Interpreter
•Interpreter ( 解释器 )is a computer program that directly executes, i.e. 
performs, instructions written in a programming or scripting 
language, without previously compiling them into a machine 
language program

•A compiler ( 编译器 )is a computer program (or a set of programs) 
that transforms source code written in a programming language (the 
source language ) into another computer language (the target 
language ), with the latter often having a binary form known as object

Syntax Error

Early learner: syntax error
•We need to learn the Python language so we can communicate our 
instructions to Python. In the beginning we will make lots of mistakes and 
speak gibberish like small children
•When you make a mistake, the computer does not think you are “cute”. It 
says “ syntax error ” –given that it “knows” the language and you are just 
learning it. It seems like Python is cruel and unfeeling
•You must remember that you are intelligent and can learn , while the 
computer is simple and very fast –but cannot learn
•It is easier for you to learn Python than for the computer to learn human 
language
The more you practice, the better you’ll be!
Hello, world!
•You must say something that Python interpreter can understand!!
•Print() is a function in Python

Exit()

Programming scripts
•Interactive Python is good for experiments and programs of 3 -4 lines 
long
•Most programs are much longer , so we have to type them in a file and 
execute them all together
•In this sense, we are giving Python a script
•As convention, “ .py” is added as the suffix on the end of these files
Interactive v.s. script
•Interactive
You type directly to Python one line at a time and it responds
•Script
You enter a sequence of statements (lines) into a file using a text 
editor and tell Python to execute the file

Elements of Python Language
•Vocabulary/words –Variables and Reserved words
•Sentence structure –valid syntax patterns
•Story structure –constructing a meaningful program for some 
purposes
Variable
•A variable is a named space in the memory where a programmer can 
store data and later retrieve the data using the variable name
•Variable names are determined by programmers
•The value of a variable can be changed later in a program

Rules for defining variables in Python
•Must start with a letter or underscore _
•Can only contain letters, numbers and underscore
•Case sensitive
•Good : apple, car, myNumber123, _light
•Bad: 456aaa, #ab, var.12
•Different : apple, Apple, APPLEcourseName _courseName
course~Name
courseName coursename
Variable

Personal tips
•Use meaningful words as variable names
•Start with a lower letter
•Capitalize the first letter of each word
•Example : myBankAccountID , numOfCards , salaryAtYear1995…
What is this code doing?

Reserved words
•You cannot use the following words as variables

Constants
•Fixed values such as numbers and letters are called 
constants , since their values won’t change
•String constants use single -quotes (‘) or double -quotes (“)
Constants
•We cannot declare a variable or value as 
constant in Python.
•By convention, we use uppercase 
letters for constant names to remind 
ourselves (and others) that these values 
should not be changed.
Data Type
•In Python, variables and constants have an associated “ type ”
•Python knows the difference between a number and a string
•Example : 

Type matters
•Python knows what type everything is
•Some operations are prohibited on certain types
•You cannot “ add 1 ” to a string
•We can check the type of something using function type()
Types of numbers
•Numbers in Python generally have two types :
Integers: 1, 2, 100, -20394209
Floating point numbers: 2.5, 3.7, 11.32309, -30.999
•There are other number types, which are variations on 
float and integer (e.g., complex numbers)
Type can change
•The type of a 
variable can be 
dynamically 
changed
•A variable’s type is 
determined by the 
value that is last 
assigned to the 
variable

Type conversion
•When an expression contains 
both integer and float, 
integers will be converted 
into float implicitly
•You can control this using 
functions int() and float()•Example :

String conversions
•You can also use int() and float() to convert strings into 
numbers
•You will get an error if the string contains characters other 
than numbers
Converting numbers into string
•We can convert numbers into string using function str()

Types of Expressions
An expression describes a computation and evaluates to a value

Anatomy of a Call Expression
add    (    2    ,    3    )
Operator Operand Operand
Operators and operands are also 
expressions
Evaluation of a Call Expression
1.Evaluate
a.Evaluate the operator subexpression
b.Evaluate each operand subexpression
2.Apply
a.Apply the value of the operator subexpression to the values of the operand 
subexpressionadd    (    2    ,    3    )
Operator Operand Operand
add(add(6, mul(4, 6)), mul(3, 5))
Humans
We like to inside inside -out
add(add(6, mul(4, 6) ), mul(3, 5))
add(add(6,    24    ), mul(3, 5))
add(add(6,    24    ) , mul(3, 5))
add( 30       , mul(3, 5))
add( 30 , mul(3, 5) )
add( 30 , 15   )
add(        30       ,     15   )

•Input function, Comments, *+* and “*” of string, Print()
Assignment statement
Assignment statement ( 赋值语句 )
Assignment with expressions
Print statement (output statement)
InPython ,=means assign the value on the right to the 
variable on the left .
Assignment statement
•We assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (=)
•An assignment statement consists of an expression on the right hand 
side, and a variable to store the result
Example : x = 100 –10 + x*3 –x/10
Assignment statement
X: 6•There is a location in the 
memory for x
•Whenever the value of x is 
needed, it can be retrieved 
from the memory
•After the expression is 
evaluated, the result will be 
put back into x
Assignment statement
X: 107.4•There is a location in the 
memory for x
•Whenever the value of x is 
needed, it can be retrieved 
from the memory
•After the expression is 
evaluated, the result will be 
put back into x
Visualizing Assignment
Names are bound to values in an environment
To execute an assignment statement:
1.Evaluate the expression to the right of =.
2.Bind the value of the expression to the name to the left of =in the 
current environment.
Final Value
BindingsNameDemo
Cascaded assignment
•We can set multiple variables into the same value using a single 
assignment statement
Example

Practice
•Write a program to exchange the values of two variables.
Simultaneous assignment
•The values of two variables can be exchanged using simultaneous 
assignment
Example
Bad use of simultaneous assignment

Order evaluation
•When we put operators together, Python needs to know which one to 
do first
•This is called “operator precedence”
•Which operator “takes precedence” over the others
Example : X = 1 + 2*3 –4 / 5 ** 6
Numeric expression and operators
•We use some keys we have on 
the keyboard to denote the 
classic math operators
•Asterisk (*) is the multiplication 
operator
•Double asterisk (**) is used to 
denote Exponentiation (raise to 
a power) 

Operator precedence rules
•Highest to lowest precedence rule
Parenthesis are always with highest priority
Power /Exponentiation
Multiplication, division and remainder
Addition and subtraction
Left to right
Operator precedence
Example : x = 1+2**3/4*5
Floor division

Floor division
-2//3=?
divmod ()

Augmented assignment
>>> x=22
>>> x=x+7
Augmented assignment
•The general form of augmented assignment looks like
Example

Personal tips
•Use parenthesis
•Keep mathematical expressions simple so that they are easy to 
understand
•Break up long series of math expressions to make them easy to 
understand
Program steps or program flow
•Like a recipe, a program is a sequence of steps to be done in pre-
determined order
•Some steps are conditional , i.e. they may be skipped
•Sometimes, we will repeat some steps
•Sometimes, we store a set of steps to be used over and over again in 
future as needed
Sequential flow
Execute sequentially
Outputs
•When a program is running, it flows from one step to the next 
•We as programmers, set up “ paths ” for the program to follow
Conditional flow
Program
 Outputs
Repeated flow
Program Outputs
•Loops (repeated steps) have iterative variables that change each time 
through a loop
•Often these iterative variables go through a sequence of numbers
What the largest number is?

What the largest number is?

User input
•We can instruct Python to stop and take user inputs 
using function input()
•The input() function returns a string
Practice
•The BMI (body mass index) of a human can be 
calculated using the following equation:
BMI = weight (kg) ÷height ^ 2 (m)
•Write a program to input a user’s weight and 
height, and then output his BMI

Converting user input
•If we want to read a number using input() , we must 
then convert the input into a number using int() or 
float()
•Later we will deal with bad input data

Comments
•Anything after a “#” is ignored by Python
•Why comment?
Describe what is going to happen in a sequence of code
Document who wrote the code and other important information
Turn off a line of code –usually temporarily
String operations
•Some operators apply to strings
“+”: concatenation
“*”: multiple concatenation
•Python knows whether it is dealing with a number or 
a string
Practice
•Write a program to instruct the user to input two of 
his friends’ names, and then output a sentence “I am 
the friend of XX and XX.”
Output using Print()

More details on print()

Examples

Example

A powerful function -eval()
•The eval() function takes a string argument and evaluates that string as a 
Python expression , i.e., just as if the programmer had directly entered the 
expression as code
•The function returns the result of that expression
•Eval() gives the programmers the flexibility to determine what to execute at 
run-time
•one should be cautious about using it in situations where users could 
potentially cause problems with “inappropriate” input
