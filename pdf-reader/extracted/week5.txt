Outline
•List basics
•List constants
•Looking inside lists
•Lists are mutable
•Len() and range()
•Two ways looping over a list
•Concatenating (+, *) and slicing (:) lists
•List methods
•Building a list from scratch with list() and append()
•Use into check if something in a list
•Sort list with sort()
•Built -in functions : max(), min(), sum() , etc. 
List is kind of a collection
•A collection allows us to put 
many values in a single
“variable”
•Instead of creating a 
separate variable for each 
item, we put them all in 
one “container” variable.

What is not a collection
•Most of our variables have only one value in them –when we put a 
new value in the variable, the old value will be over -written

List constants
•List constants are surrounded 
by square brackets and the 
elements in the list are 
separated by commas
•A list element can be any 
Python object –even another 
list
•A list can be empty

List and definite loop -best pal

Looking inside lists
•Just like strings, we can access any single element in a list 
using an index specified in square bracket

Lists are mutable
•Strings are “ immutable ” –
we cannot change the 
contents of a string unless 
we make a new string
•Lists are “ mutable ” –we 
can change an element of 
a list using index operator

Mutable and immutable Variable

How long is a list?
•The len() function takes a 
list as input and returns 
the number of elements in 
that list
•Actually len() tells us the 
number of elements in any 
sequence (e.g. strings)

Range() function
•The range() function returns a list 
of numbers 
•We can construct an index loop 
using for and an integer iterator

Two ways looping over a list
Example
 Output
Concatenating lists using + and *
•Similar to strings, we 
can add two existing 
lists together to create 
a new list
•We can also repeat a 
list with many times 
using *

Lists can be sliced using :
•Remember: similar 
to strings, the 
second number is 
“up to but no 
including ”

List methods
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more -on-lists
Building a list from scratch
•We can create an empty list 
using list(), and then add 
elements using append() 
method
•The list stays in order , and 
new elements are added at 
the end of the list

Is something in a list
•Python provides two 
operators to check whether 
an item is in a list
•These are logical operators 
that return True or False
•They do not modify the list

A list is an ordered sequence
•A list can hold many items 
and keeps them in the order 
until we do something to 
change the order
•A list can be sorted (i.e. 
change the order)
•The sort() method means 
“sort yourself”

Built -in functions and lists
•There are a number of 
functions built into Python 
that take lists as inputs
•Remember the loops we 
built? These are much 
simpler

Averaging with a list

Practice
•Write a program to instruct the user to input several 
numbers and calculate their average using list methods
Best friends: strings and lists
•Use the split() method to 
break up a string into a 
list of strings
•We think of these as 
words
•We can access a particular 
word or loop through all 
the words

•When you do not specify a 
delimiter , multiple spaces 
are treated like “one”  
delimiter
•You can specify what 
delimiter character to use in 
splitting

Practice
•The header of an email takes the following format:
From professor.xman@uct.edu Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008
For a given email header, write a program to find out the domain of 
email address, and the month in which this email is sent
The double split pattern
•Sometimes we split a line one way, and then grab one piece of the 
line and split it again

Outline
•Dictionary basics
•Definition
•List v.s. dictionary
•Dictionary literals 
•Counting with a dictionary
•The get() method 
•Retrieving lists of keys and values
•Look through a dictionary
•For
•Two iteration variables -key and value
•Tuples
A story of two collections
•List: a linear collection of 
values that stay in order
•Dictionary : a “bag” of 
values, each with its own 
label

Dictionary
•Dictionaries are Python’s most powerful data collection
•Dictionaries allow us to do fast database -like operations in 
Python
•Dictionaries have different names in different languages
•Associative arrays –Perl/PHP
•Properties or Map or HashMap –Java
•Property Bag –C#/.Net
Dictionary
•Lists index their entries based 
on the position in the list
•Dictionaries are like bags –no 
order
•We index the elements we put 
in the dictionary with a 
“lookup tag ”

List v.s. dictionary
•Dictionaries are similar to lists, except that they use keys instead of 
numbers to look up values


Dictionary literals (constants)
•Dictionary literals use curly braces and have list of key:value pairs
•You can make an empty dictionary using empty curly braces

Counting with a dictionary
•A common use of dictionary is counting how often we “see” 
something

Dictionary tracebacks
•It is an error to reference a key which is not in the dictionary
•We can use the inoperator to see if a key is in the dictionary

Practice
•Write a program to instruct the user to continuously input 
some words, and use dictionary to count how many times a 
word has been inputted before. 
The get() method 
•This pattern of checking to see if a keyis already in a dictionary, and 
assuming a default value if the key is not there is so common, that 
there is a method called get() that does this for us

Practice
•Write a program to instruct the user to input a line of texts, and use 
dictionary to count how many times a word has been seen in this line. 
You should use the get() method in this program.  
Retrieving lists of keys and values
•You can get a list of 
keys , values or items
(both) from a 
dictionary

Definite loops and dictionaries
•Even though dictionaries are not stored in order , we can write a for 
loop that goes through all elements in a dictionary –actually it goes 
through all the keys in that dictionary and looks up the values

Bonus: two iteration variables
•We loop through the 
key-value pairs in a 
dictionary using two
iteration variables
•Each iteration, the first 
variable is the key, and 
the second variable is 
the corresponding 
value for the key
Tuples
•Tuples are another type of sequence that function more like a list –
they have elements which are indexed starting from 0

But, tuples are “immutable”
•Unlike a list, once you create a tuple, you cannot change its contents 
–similar to a string

Some things that you cannot do 
with tuples

A tale of two sequences

Tuples are more efficient
•Since Python doe snot have to build tuple structures to be 
modifiable, they are simpler and more efficient in terms of 
memory use and performance than lists
•In our program when we are making “temporary variables” 
we prefer tuples over lists
Tuples and dictionaries
•The item() method in 
dictionaries returns a 
list of (key, value) 
tuples

Tuples are comparable
•The comparison operators work with tuples and other sequences if 
the first item is equal . Python goes on to the next element, until it 
finds the elements which are different

Sorting lists of tuples
•We can take advantage of the ability to sort a list of tuples to get a 
sorted version of a dictionary
•First we sort the dictionary by the key using the items() method

Using sorted()
•We can also do this 
using a built -in function 
sorted() which takes a 
sequence as a 
parameter and returns 
a sorted sequence

Sort vs Sorted
•Use .sort() if you want to sort a list and keep only the sorted version.
•Use sorted() when you want a sorted copy but keep the original 
unchanged.

Practice
•Write a program, which sorts the elements of a 
dictionary by the value of each element 
Sort by values instead of key
•If we could construct a 
list of tuples of the form 
(key, value) we could sort
by value
•We do this with a for 
loop that creates a list of 
tuples

in a file
