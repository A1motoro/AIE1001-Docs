What is Code? Software? Program?
•A sequence of instructions
•Computers take the instructions and execute them
•It is a little piece of our intelligence in the computer
•Intelligence is re-usable
Programs for human
(Video: Algorithms)
•Making an instant coffee
Computers are good at following instructions
•Humans can easily make mistakes when following a set of 
instructions
•On the contrary, computers (usually) won’t make mistakes , 
regardless of they are given 10 or 10 billion instructions !!
Computer Hardware
ProgramHard disks, CDs, 
DVDs, USBs
Key components in a computer
•Central processing unit (CPU): execute your program. Similar to human 
brain, very fast but not that smart
•Input device : take inputs from users or other devices
•Output device : output information to users or other devices
•Main memory : store data, fast and temporary storage
•Secondary memory : slower but large size, permanent storage
Von Neumann Architecture
•The modern computer 
architecture is proposed by John 
Von Neumann

The theoretical foundation of 
computer science
•The theoretical foundation of 
computer science is built by Alan 
Turing
•Father of theoretical computer science 
and artificial intelligence
•Computability theory and Turing test

Central Processing Unit
•A processor contains two units, a control unit (CU) and an 
arithmetic/logic unit (ALU)
•CUis used to fetch commands from the memory
•ALU contains the electric circuits which can execute 
commands
Central Processing Unit
•Processor manufacturer: Intel, AMD, ARM , etc
Memory/Storage
•High speed cache
•Internal RAM
•Internal ROM 
•Flash
•Hard disk

Input/output devices
•Input devices : mouse, 
keyboard, panel, touch screen, 
audio input, mind reading, etc
•Output devices : screen, audio 
output, etc

How the hard disk works

What can a computer actually understand?
•How canacomputer understand anumber (e.g., 8)?
Low level language –Assembly Language
•An assembly language is a low -level 
programming language, in which there is a 
very strong (generally one -to-one) 
correspondence between the language and 
machine code instructions.
•Each assembly language is specific to a 
particular computer architecture
•Assembly language is converted into 
executable machine code by a utility 
program referred to as an assembler

C Language (1969 -1973)
•C was developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at AT&T Bell Labs
•One of the early high -level programming language
•Somewhere between assembly and other high level languages
•Provide powerful functionalities for low level memory manipulations
•Have the highest efficiency within high level languages
•Very widely used in low level applications, such as operating systems, embedded 
programming, super computers, etc
C++ Language (1979)
•C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979
•Inherent major features of C
•An object oriented programming language, supporting code reuse
•High efficiency and powerful in low level memory manipulation
•Still platform dependent
Java Language (1995)
•Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has 
since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995
•A new generation of general -purpose object oriented programming 
language
•Platform independent, “"write once, run anywhere” (WORA)
•Java is one of the most popular programming languages currently in 
use
Python (1991)
•Developed by Guido van Rossum in 1989, and formally released in 1991
•An open source, object oriented programming language
•Powerful libraries
•Powerful interfaces to integrate other programming languages (C/C++, 
Java, and many other languages)
•Programming language of the year 2010
Language efficiency v.s. development efficiency
•High level languages cannot be executed directly
•High level languages must be converted into low level languages first
•Lower level languages have higher language efficiency (they are faster to 
run on a computer)
•Higher level languages have higher development efficiency (it is easier to 
write programs in these languages )
•(Video: Programming Languages)
Operating Systems
•The operating system (OS) is a low level program , which 
provides all basic services for managing and controlling a 
computer’s activities
•Applications are programs which are built based upon an 
OS
•Main functions of an OS:
Controlling and monitoring system activities
Allocating and assigning system resources
Scheduling operations
(Demo: mac terminal)
•Popular OS: Windows, Mac OS, Linux, iOS, Android…
(Video: Operating System)
Abstraction
•Machine language -> Assembly -> C->Python
•Hardware ->OS->Apps/Software applications
•Binary digits ->Primitive data types ->Data structures
Data Representation and Conversion
•We use positional notation ( 进位记数法 ) to represent or encode numbers 
in a computer
•Data are stored essentially as binary numbers in a computer
•In practice, we usually represent data using either binary (二进制 ), decimal 
(十进制 ), octal (八进制 ) or hexadecimal ( 十六进制 )number systems
•We may need to convert data between different number systems
(Video: Binary)10
The basic idea of positional notation
•Each positional number system contains two elements, a base (基数 )
and a set of symbols
•Using the decimal system ( 十进制系统 ) as an example, its base is 10 , 
and the symbols are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
•When a number “hits” 9, the next number will not be a different 
symbol, but a “1” followed by a “0” (逢十进一 )
Decimal number system
•In the decimal number system, the base is 10, the symbols include 0, 1, 2, 
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
•Every number can be decomposed into the sum of a series of numbers, 
each is represented by a positional value times a weight
•𝑁=𝑎𝑛×10𝑛+𝑎𝑛−1×10𝑛−1+𝑎𝑛−2×10𝑛−2……+𝑎0×100+𝑎−1×
10−1+𝑎−2×10−2…
•𝑎𝑛is the positional value (ranging from 0 to 9), while 10𝑛represents the 
weight 
Binary number system
•In the binary system, the base is 2, we use only two symbols 0 and 1
•“10” is used when we hit 2 (逢二进一 )
•𝑁=𝑎𝑛×2𝑛+𝑎𝑛−1×2𝑛−1+𝑎𝑛−2×2𝑛−2……+𝑎0×20+
𝑎−1×2−1+𝑎−2×2−2…
•𝑎𝑛is the positional value (ranging from 0 to 1), while 2𝑛represents 
the weight 9(10)=1×23+ 0×22+ 0×21+ 1×20=1001(2)
Why use binary number?
•Easy to implement physically
•Simple calculation rules
•Easy to combine arithmetic and logic operations
Hexadecimal number system
•In the hexadecimal system, the base is 16, we use 16 symbols {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f}
•“10” is used when we hit 16 (逢十六进一 )
•𝑁=𝑎𝑛×16𝑛+𝑎𝑛−1×16𝑛−1+𝑎𝑛−2×16𝑛−2……+𝑎0×160+𝑎−1×
16−1+𝑎−2×16−2…
•𝑎𝑛is the positional value (ranging from 0 to 15), while 16𝑛represents the 
weight

Converting decimal fraction into binary fraction
Example : (0.875)10=(?)2
0.875×2=1.75 Integer part: 1
0.75×2=1.5 Integer part: 1
0.5×2=1 Integer part: 1
Answer : (0.875)10=(0.111)2
Practice : (0.6875)10=(?)2Lower positionHigher position
Converting decimal fraction into binary fraction
Answer :
0.6875×2=1.375 Integer part: 1
0.375×2=0.75 Integer part: 0
0.75×2=1.5              Integer part: 1
0.5×2=1 Integer part: 1
So, (0.6875)10=(0.1011)2Lower positionHigher position
Converting decimal number into binary number
•For a decimal number that has both integer and fractional 
parts
•Convert the integer and fractional parts separately

binary number and one digit octal number
(0)8=(000)2
(1)8=(001)2
(2)8=(010)2
(3)8=(011)2
(4)8=(100)2
(5)8=(101)2
(6)8=(110)2
(7)8=(111)2

•When there is not enough lower positions in the fractional part , fill with 
0
•Keep the digit order unchanged
Converting binary number into hexadecimal 
number
Example:
The units of information (data) 
•Bit (比特 /位): a binary digit which takes either 0 or 1
•Bit is the smallest information unit in computer programming
•Byte (字节 ): 1 byte = 8 bits, every English character is represented by 1 
byte
•KB (千字节 )：1 KB = 2^10 B = 1024 B
•MB (兆字节 )：1MB = 2^20 B = 1024 KB
•GB (千兆字节 )：1GB = 2^30 B = 1024 MB
•TB (兆兆字节 )：1TB = 2^40 B = 1024 GB
Memory and addressing
•A computer’s memory consists 
of an ordered sequence of 
bytes for storing data
•Every location in the memory 
has a unique address
•The key difference between 
high and low level 
programming languages is 
whether programmer has to 
deal with memory addressing 
directly
