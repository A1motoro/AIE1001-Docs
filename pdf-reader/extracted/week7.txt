object
Object
•
An 
object
represents an entity in 
the real world that can be 
distinctly identified.
•
Examples
: a student, a desk, a 
circle, a button, and even a loan
•
An object has a unique 
identity
, 
state
, and 
behaviours

Object
•
In Python, 
everything
is an 
object (number, string, 
etc
)
•
You can use the 
id() 
function 
and 
type()
function to get 
information about an object

ID and type
•
The 
id
of an object is automatically assigned a unique integer by 
Python when the program is executed
•
The id for the object 
will not be changed 
during the execution of the 
program
•
The 
type
for the object is determined by Python according to the 
value of the object
Variable is actually only a reference
•
A 
variable
in Python is actually a 
reference
to an object.

Class
•
Objects of the same kind are defined by using a common 
class
•
The relationship between Classes and objects is analogous to 
that between an apple
-
pie recipe and apple pies
•
A Python 
class
uses 
variables
to store data fields and defines 
methods
to perform actions
•
A class is a 
contract
—
also sometimes called a template or 
blueprint
Object 
v.s
. class
•
An object is an 
instance
of a class, and you can create 
many instances 
of a 
class
•
Creating an instance of a class is referred to as 
instantiation
•
The terms object and instance are often used interchangeably

Methods
•
You can perform 
operations
on 
an object
•
The operations are defined 
using 
functions
•
The functions for the objects are 
called 
methods
in Python
•
Methods can only be invoked 
from 
a specific object

Data fields
•
Data fields
are 
variables
that
store information inside an object.
•
They 
describe the
state
or
properties
of that object.
•
In 
Python, we 
also 
call them
states
, 
attributes
or
properties
.
Key elements of an object
•
Identity
: 
a
unique way to distinguish the object from others in memory. 
It’
s 
like a person’s ID. Python automatically assigns each object 
a unique id 
for 
identifying the object at runtime.
•
State
: 
t
he 
data stored inside the object 
—
this describes the object. 
An 
object’s 
state
(also known as 
its 
properties
or 
attributes
) is represented by 
variables, called 
data fields
.
•
Methods
: 
The actions the object can perform 
—
defined in its class. 
Python 
uses 
methods 
to define an object’s 
behavior
. You 
make an object perform 
an action by invoking a method on that object.
Class Example
•
Class name
: 
Student
•
Data fields
: 
Name, Age, Grade, …
•
Methods
:
updateGrade
()
isAdult
()
displayInfo
()
……
Why we need object oriented programming?
•
To Organize Code Better (
Modularity): 
Big programs can get messy if written as one 
long list of 
instructions. OOP 
helps us split the 
program into
classes
and
objects. Each 
class handles one type of thing, keeping its
data
and
actions
together.
•
To Reuse Code (Reusability
): 
Once 
we create a
class, we can make as many objects 
from it as we need 
—
no need to write the code again.
•
To Make Big Projects Easier to 
Maintain
: 
In OOP , data and actions are stored together 
inside objects 
—
changes happen inside the class without affecting unrelated parts.
•
To Model Real
-
World 
Problems
: 
OOP 
lets us create
digital versions of real
-
world things 
and 
allows us to write program in a way that naturally match the problem that we are 
trying to solve.
Built
-
in Class
•
A built
-
in class is a class that comes predefined in Python.
•
You don’t have to write the blueprint 
—
Python already provides it.
•
Examples: 
str
, 
int
, list, 
dict
, tuple, etc
.

Custom 
Class
•
A
custom class
is a class
you create yourself
to define new types of 
objects specific to your needs.
•
You write the blueprint 
(data fields/attributes 
+ methods).

Comparisons between Built
-
in and custom class

Define class
•
Python uses the following syntax to define a class

Define class
•
Python uses the following syntax to define a class
•
A
class provides a special method, 
__
init
__()
. This method, known as 
an 
initializer
, is invoked to initialize a new object’s state when it is 
created

Example

Self
•
All methods, including the 
initializer, have the first 
parameter 
self
•
This parameter refers to the 
object that invokes the 
method
. 
•
The 
self
parameter in the 
__
init
__() 
method is 
automatically set to 
reference the object that 
was just created

Scope of self
•
The scope of an instance 
variable is the 
entire 
class
once it is created
•
You can also create 
local 
variables
in a method 
•
The scope of a local 
variable is 
within the 
method
Constructing objects
•
Once a 
class
is defined, you can 
create objects 
from the class with a 
constructor
. The constructor does two things:

It creates an object in the memory for the class

It invokes the class’s 
__
init
__() 
method to initialize the object

Constructor arguments
•
The arguments of the constructor 
match
the parameters in the 
__
init
__() 
method 
without 
self
•
The initializer in the Circle class has a 
default
radius value, then the 
constructor 
without arguments 
will assign the default values to data 
fields

Accessing member of objects
•
Data fields 
are also called 
instance variables
, 
because each object (instance) has a specific 
value for a data field
•
Methods
are also called 
instance methods
, 
because a method which is invoked by an object 
(instance) will perform actions based on the data 
fields of that object
•
You can access the object’s data fields and 
invoke its methods by using the 
dot operator (.)
, 
also known as the 
object member access 
operator

Hiding data fields
•
Direct access 
of a data field in an object is 
not good
!! 
•
First, data may be 
tampered with
•
Second, the class becomes 
difficult to maintain 
and 
vulnerable to bugs
Private data fields
•
Prevent other programmers from directly accessing the data 
fields of your class is a common industrial practice
•
This is known as 
data hiding
•
This can be done by defining 
private data fields
Private data fields
•
In Python, the 
private data fields 
are defined with two 
leading 
underscores
. You can also define a 
private method 
named with two 
leading underscores
•
Private data fields and methods 
can be accessed within a class, but 
they 
cannot be accessed outside 
the class
•
Define some 
methods
to allow 
access to private data fields

Practice
•
What is the problem with this program?

Practice
•
Is the above code correct? If yes, what would be the output?

Practice
•
Is the above code correct? If not, how do we fix it?
Solution
Option 1: Make the attribute public
Option 2: Keep it private but use a getter method

Abstraction
•
Abstraction means separate the 
implementation
of a part of code 
from the 
usage
of that code
•
T
here 
are many levels of abstraction, a commonly used one is called 
function abstraction
•
Function abstraction means separating the implementation of a 
function from its usage
•
Abstraction makes your code easy to 
maintain, debug 
and 
reuse
Example

Programmer 1 
Write and maintain 
isPrime
() 
Programmer 2 
Write and maintain 
printPrimeNumbers
() 
If we write everything 
together…
Class abstraction and encapsulation
•
Class abstraction 
means separating class implementation 
from the use of a class 
•
The class implementation details are 
invisible
from the user
•
The class’s collection of methods, together with the 
description of how these methods are expected to behave, 
serves as the class’s 
contract
with the client
Class abstraction and encapsulation
•
The user of the class does not need to know how the class is 
implemented. The details of implementation are 
encapsulated 
and 
hidden
from the user. 
•
This is known as 
class encapsulation
•
In essence, encapsulation combines data and methods into a single 
object and hides the data fields and method implementation from 
the user
Class abstraction and encapsulation
•
Encapsulation: 
hidden 
implementation
for the internal parts of 
the 
computer 
(CPU, ROM, hard drive).
•
Abstraction: 
public interface for user
for 
the visible parts (monitor, keyboard, 
mouse, power button).

Example 
–
BMI calculation

The code to use BMI class
•
We can use the BMI class if 
you have its 
contract 
•
You 
don’t need to know 
the 
details about how it is 
implemented!!
The BMI class

Loan

Example of loan class
Practice
(The Rectangle class) Following the example of the Circle class, design a 
class named Rectangle to represent a rectangle. The class contains:
■
Two data fields named width and height.
■
A constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified width and 
height.
The default values are 1 and 2 for the width and height, respectively.
■
A method named 
getArea
() that returns the area of this rectangle.
■
A method named 
getPerimeter
() that returns the perimeter.
Practice
(The Stock class) Design a class named Stock to represent a company’s stock that contains:
■
A private string data field named symbol for the stock’s symbol.
■
A private string data field named name for the stock’s name.
■
A private float data field named 
previousClosingPrice
that stores the stock price for the previous 
day.
■
A private float data field named 
currentPrice
that stores the stock price for the current time.
■
A constructor that creates a stock with the specified symbol, name, previous price, and current 
price.
■
A get method for returning the stock name.
■
A get method for returning the stock symbol.
■
Get and set methods for getting/setting the stock’s previous price. 
■
Get and set methods for getting/setting the stock’s current price.
■
A method named 
getChangePercent
() that returns the percentage changed from 
previousClosingPrice
to 
currentPrice
.
