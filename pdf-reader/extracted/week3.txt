Comparison operators
•Boolean expressions ask a question and 
produce a Yes/No result, which we use 
to control program flow
•Boolean expressions use comparison 
operators to evaluate Yes/No or 
True/False
•Comparison operators check variables 
but do not change the values of 
variables
•Careful!! “=“ is used for assignment

Examples of comparison

Examples of comparison
•String comparison is lexicographical
ASCII Code
•American Standard Code for Information Interchange
•It’s like a dictionary that tells the computer which number 
represents which character (letters, digits, punctuation, and 
control symbols)
•Computers only understand numbers (binary: 0 and 1).
To store and process tex t(like "A","hello" , or"123" ), we need a 
way to convert characters into numbers and back again.
•Supports 128 characters (English letters, numbers, and a few 
symbols).
ASCII Code
•32-126 are printable characters

Unicode
•Universal character encoding standard that 
maps every character and symbol from every 
language to a unique number, called a code point .
•ASCII only supports 128 characters (English letters, 
numbers, and a few symbols ).
•Aninternational version of ASCII —it can 
represent far more than just English letters and 
symbols .
•Asingle standard that works across all platforms 
and languages
•ASCII is a subset of Unicode

Examples of comparison
•String comparison is lexicographical
Examples of comparison
•Floating -point comparison
Floating point math
•Floating point numbers areapproximated
•Rational numbers (such as 0.1, which is 1/ 10) whose denominator is 
not a power of two cannot be exactly represented
•0.100000000000000005551115123125782702118158340454101562

•Python ’sfloat is an IEEE -754 double -precision number (64 bits ).It can 
only store about 15–17 significant decimal digits precisely.

Boolean type
•Python contains a built -in Boolean type , which takes two 
values True/False
George Boole (1815 -1864): Mathematician, inventor of mathematical 
logic, significant contributions to differential and difference equations

Boolean type
•Python contains a built -in Boolean type , which takes two 
values True/False
•Number 0 can also be used to represent False. All other 
numbers represent True
Boolean type
•Falsy values (evaluates to False):
•None
•False
•0, 0.0, 0j (numeric zero in any type)
•Empty sequences/collections: "", [], {}, set(), range(0)
•Everything else is truthy (evaluates to True).
Bool()

One way decisions

Indentation
•Increase indent : indent after an ifor forstatement (after :)
•Maintain indent : to indicate the scope of the block (which lines are 
affected by the if/for )
•Decrease indent : to back to the level of the if statement or for

Indentation
•Blank lines are ignored –they do not affect indentation
•Comments on a line by themselves are ignored w.r.t. indentation

Increase /maintain /decrease
•Increase /maintain after 
if/for statements
•Decrease to indicate the 
end of a block
•Blank lines and 
comments are ignored
Nested decisions
Example
Mental begin/end

Too many nested decisions will be a disaster…
Two way decisions
•Sometimes we want to do one 
thing when the logical expression 
is true, and another thing when it 
is false
•It is like a fork in the road, we need 
to choose one or the other path , 
but not both

Two way decision using else

Tips on if -else
•Else must come after if
•Use indentation to match ifand else
Example

Afirst look atListandTuple
•Tostore asequence ofelements (e.g., numbers)
•Access anysingle element using anindex specified insquare bracket
•Lists aremutable, while Tuples arenot

Practice
•Write a program to instruct a user to input a date (both 
month and day), and then output the new month and day 
when the inputted date is advanced by one day (leap years 
are ignored)
Answer

Multi -way decisions

Multi -way decision

Multi -way decision

Which will never beprint ed?

Practice
•Write a program to instruct the user to input the working 
hours and hourly rate, and then output the salary. If the 
working hours exceed 40 hours, then the extra hours 
received 1.5 times pay. 
Outline
•Logical operators
•Try/except structure
•Repeated Flow
•Infinite loop
•Break
•Continue
•Indefinite loop (while), Definite loop (for)
•Identity operators
Logical operators
•Logical operators can be used to combine several 
logical expressions into a single expression
•Python has three logical operators: not, and, or

Example

Example

Try/except structure
•You surround a dangerous part of code with try/except
•If the code in try block works , the except block is skipped
•If the code in try block fails, the except block will be executed

Example

Use try/except to capture errors
•When the first conversion fails, it just 
stops into the except block , and the 
program continues
•When the second conversion 
succeeds , it just skips the except 
block
Try/except

Example

Repeated flow
Program Outputs
•Loops (repeated steps) have iterative variables that change each time 
through a loop
•Often these iterative variables go through a sequence of numbers
An infinite loop
•What is wrong with this program?

Another loop
•What is wrong with this program?

Breaking out of a loop
•The break statement ends the current loop, and jumps to the 
statement which directly follows the loop

Finishing an iteration with continue
•The continue statement ends the current iteration, and start 
the next iteration immediately

Indefinite loop
•While loops are called “indefinite loops”, since they keep going until a 
logical condition becomes false
•Till now, the loops we have seen are relatively easy to check whether 
they will terminate 
•Sometimes it can be hard to determine whether a loop will terminate
Definite loop
•Quite often we have a finite set of items
•We can use a loop, each iteration of which will be executed for each 
item in the set, using the forstatement
•These loops are called “definite loops” because they execute an exact 
number of times
•It is said that “definite loops iterate through the members of a set”
A simple for loop
Example Output
For loop
Example Output
•For loops (definite loops) have explicit iteration variables that change 
each time through a loop. 
•These iteration variables move through a sequence or a set 
In
•The iteration variable “ iterates ” 
through a sequence (ordered set)
•The block (body) of the code is 
executed once for each value inthe 
sequence
•The iteration variable moves 
through allof the values in the 
sequence
Sequence with 
five elements Iteration variable
Another example
Example Output
Loop samples
•Note: though these examples are simple, the patterns apply 
to all kinds of loops
Making “smart” loops
•The trick is “knowing” something 
about the whole loop when you 
are stuck writing code that only 
sees one entry at a time

Looping through a set
Example Output
Finding the largest number 
•Use a variable to store the largest number we have seen so far
•If the current number is larger , we assign it to the store variable
Example Output

Counting in a loop
•To count how many times we have executed a loop, we can introduce 
a counting variable, which increases itself in each iteration
Example Output
Practice
•Given a set of numbers, write a program to calculate 
their sum using for loop
Answer

Practice
•Given a set of numbers, write a program to calculate 
their average using for loop
Answer

Filtering in a loop 
•We can use an ifstatement in a loop to catch/filter the values we are 
interested at
Example Output
Search using a Boolean variable
Example Output
•If we want to search in a set and double check whether a specific number is in 
that set
•We can use a Boolean variable, set it to False at the beginning , and assign True to 
it as long as the target number is found
Finding the largest number 
•Use a variable to store the largest number we have seen so far
•If the current number is larger , we assign it to the store variable
Example Output
Finding the smallest number
•Use a variable to store the smallest number we have seen so far
•If the current number is smaller , we assign it to the store variable
•What is the problem with this program?
Finding the smallest number
Example Output
•We still use a variable to store the smallest value seen so far
•In the first iteration, the smallest value is none , so we need to use an 
if statement to check this
Identity operators
•isand is not operator
•Python has a “ is” operator which 
can be used in logical expression
•Implies “ is the same as ”
•Similar to, but stronger than ==
•“is not ” is also an operator

Identity operators
Example Output
