Class and Object
•
Class
•
A
class
is a
blueprint
or
template
for 
creating objects.
•
It describes
what 
data
(
attributes/data 
fields) 
and
what actions
(methods) the 
objects will have.
•
A class itself is
not
an actual thing 
—
it’s just a design.
•
Object
•
An
object
is an
actual 
instance
created from a class.
•
It’s a
real thing in memory
with its 
own data.
•
You can create many objects from 
the same class, each with different 
values.
Class and Object

Key Points for Defining a Class in 
Python
1. Use 
the class 
keyword
•
Start with
class
followed by the class name (first letter 
usually capitalized) 
2. Attributes 
(Data Fields
)
•
Variables that store data
inside the object.
•
Usually defined and initialized in the constructor 
(__
init
__()
method).
3. Methods 
(Functions inside the class
)
•
Actions the object can perform.
•
Always include self as the first parameter to work with 
that object’s data.
Self
•
In Python classes, self 
is a reference to the 
current object.
•
It lets the method 
know which object’s 
data it should work 
with.
•
Python automatically 
passes self as the first 
argument to instance 
methods.
An object has its own attributes and actions.
In a class, since we don
’
t have a specific object yet, we use
self
to represent the object.
Constructor
•
__
init
__ 
Method
•
Special built
-
in method that runs automatically when an object is 
created.
•
Used to
initialize attributes
.
•
When creating an object, the arguments you pass must match the 
parameters in the
__
init
__()
method 
—
excluding
self.
