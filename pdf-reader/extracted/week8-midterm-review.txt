Decimal number system
•In the decimal number system, the base is 10, the symbols include 0, 1, 2, 
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
•Every number can be decomposed into the sum of a series of numbers, 
each is represented by a positional value times a weight
•𝑁=𝑎𝑛×10𝑛+𝑎𝑛−1×10𝑛−1+𝑎𝑛−2×10𝑛−2……+𝑎0×100+𝑎−1×
10−1+𝑎−2×10−2…
•𝑎𝑛is the positional value (ranging from 0 to 9), while 10𝑛represents the 
weight 
Binary number system
•In the binary system, the base is 2, we use only two symbols 0 and 1
•“10” is used when we hit 2 (逢二进一 )
•𝑁=𝑎𝑛×2𝑛+𝑎𝑛−1×2𝑛−1+𝑎𝑛−2×2𝑛−2……+𝑎0×20+
𝑎−1×2−1+𝑎−2×2−2…
•𝑎𝑛is the positional value (ranging from 0 to 1), while 2𝑛represents 
the weight 9(10)=1×23+ 0×22+ 0×21+ 1×20=1001(2)
Hexadecimal number system
•In the hexadecimal system, the base is 16, we use 16 symbols {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f}
•“10” is used when we hit 16 (逢十六进一 )
•𝑁=𝑎𝑛×16𝑛+𝑎𝑛−1×16𝑛−1+𝑎𝑛−2×16𝑛−2……+𝑎0×160+𝑎−1×
16−1+𝑎−2×16−2…
•𝑎𝑛is the positional value (ranging from 0 to 15), while 16𝑛represents the 
weight 
Notes:

Interactive v.s. script
•Interactive
You type directly to Python one line at a time and it responds
•Script
You enter a sequence of statements (lines) into a file using a text 
editor and tell Python to execute the file
Syntax Error

Program steps or program flow
•Like a recipe, a program is a sequence of steps to be done in pre-
determined order
•Some steps are conditional , i.e. they may be skipped
•Sometimes, we will repeat some steps
•Sometimes, we store a set of steps to be used over and over again in 
future as needed
Sequential flow
Execute sequentially
Outputs
•When a program is running, it flows from one step to the next 
•We as programmers, set up “ paths ” for the program to follow
Conditional flow
Program
 Outputs
Repeated flow
Program Outputs
•Loops (repeated steps) have iterative variables that change each time 
through a loop
•Often these iterative variables go through a sequence of numbers


Type conversion
•When an expression contains 
both integer and float, 
integers will be converted 
into float implicitly
•You can control this using 
functions int() and float()•Example :

String conversions
•You can also use int() and float() to convert strings into 
numbers
•You will get an error if the string contains characters other 
than numbers
Converting numbers into string
•We can convert numbers into string using function str()



Assignment statement
•We assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (=)
•An assignment statement consists of an expression on the right hand 
side, and a variable to store the result
Example : x = 100 –10 + x*3 –x/10
Assignment statement
X: 6•There is a location in the 
memory for x
•Whenever the value of x is 
needed, it can be retrieved 
from the memory
•After the expression is 
evaluated, the result will be 
put back into x
Assignment statement
X: 107.4•There is a location in the 
memory for x
•Whenever the value of x is 
needed, it can be retrieved 
from the memory
•After the expression is 
evaluated, the result will be 
put back into x
Cascaded assignment
•We can set multiple variables into the same value using a single 
assignment statement
Example

Simultaneous assignment
•The values of two variables can be exchanged using simultaneous 
assignment
Example
Bad use of simultaneous assignment

Operator precedence
Example : x = 1+2**3/4*5
Floor division

divmod ()


Conditional flow
Program
 Outputs
Comparison operators
•Boolean expressions ask a question and 
produce a Yes/No result, which we use 
to control program flow
•Boolean expressions use comparison 
operators to evaluate Yes/No or 
True/False
•Comparison operators check variables 
but do not change the values of 
variables
•Careful!! “=“ is used for assignment

Comparison operators

Examples of comparison

Bool()

One way decisions

Nested decisions
Example
Two way decision using else

Multi -way decisions

Which will never beprint ed?

Example

Example


An infinite loop
•What is wrong with this program?

Definite loop
•Quite often we have a finite set of items
•We can use a loop, each iteration of which will be executed for each 
item in the set, using the forstatement
•These loops are called “definite loops” because they execute an exact 
number of times
•It is said that “definite loops iterate through the members of a set”
Practice
•Given a set of numbers, write a program to calculate 
their sum using for loop
Answer

Practice
•Given a set of numbers, write a program to calculate 
their average using for loop
Answer

Search using a Boolean variable
Example Output
•If we want to search in a set and double check whether a specific number is in 
that set
•We can use a Boolean variable, set it to False at the beginning , and assign True to 
it as long as the target number is found
Finding the largest number 
•Use a variable to store the largest number we have seen so far
•If the current number is larger , we assign it to the store variable
Example Output
Finding the smallest number
•Use a variable to store the smallest number we have seen so far
•If the current number is smaller , we assign it to the store variable
•What is the problem with this program?
Finding the smallest number
Example Output
•We still use a variable to store the smallest value seen so far
•In the first iteration, the smallest value is none , so we need to use an 
if statement to check this
The isand is not operator
•Python has a “ is” operator which 
can be used in logical expression
•Implies “ is the same as ”
•Similar to, but stronger than ==
•“is not ” is also an operator
More about Bool()


A sample code
Program Output

Argument, parameter, and result

Result

Functions without return
•When a function has 
no return statement , 
it will return None
Scope of variables
•The scope of a variable is the 
part of program where this 
variable can be accessed
•A variable created inside a 
function is referred to as a 
local variable
•Global variables are created 
outside all functions and are 
accessible to all functions in 
their scope

Scope of variables
•Different variables may 
share a name if they have 
different scopes

Global variable
•In a function, you can use keyword 
global to specify that a variable is a 
global variable
•Be very careful when define and 
use global variable


Default argument
•Python allows you to define functions with default argument values
•The default argument values will be passed to the function, when it is 
invoked without arguments
Return multiple values
•Python allows a function to 
return multiple values
•The sort function returns two 
values; when it is invoked, you 
need to pass the returned 
values in a simultaneous 
assignment




Looking inside strings
•We can get any character in a string 
using an index specified in square 
brackets
•The index value must be an integer
which starts from zero
•The index value can be an expression

Index out of range
•You will get an Python 
error if you attempt to 
index beyond the end of 
a string
•Be careful when 
specifying an index value 

Strings have length
•There is a built -in function 
len() which gives us the length
of a string

Len() function

Looping through strings
•Using a for 
statement, we can 
easily loop 
through each 
character in a 
string
•String is 
essentially a listin 
Python

Practice
•Write a program to use a while statement together 
with len() function to loop through a given string
Example



How long is a list?
•The len() function takes a 
list as input and returns 
the number of elements in 
that list
•Actually len() tells us the 
number of elements in any 
sequence (e.g. strings)

Range() function
•The range() function returns a list 
of numbers 
•We can construct an index loop 
using for and an integer iterator

Range() function
•What is the output of the following code?
•squares = [x * x for x in range(5) if x % 2 == 0]
•A. [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
•B. [0, 2, 4]
•C. [0, 4, 16] 
•D. [0, 4, 8]
A tale of two loops
Example
 Output
Concatenating lists using +
•Similar to strings, we 
can add two existing 
lists together to create 
a new list

Lists can be sliced using :
•Remember: similar 
to strings, the 
second number is 
“up to but no 
including ”

Built -in functions and lists
•There are a number of 
functions built into Python 
that take lists as inputs
•Remember the loops we 
built? These are much 
simpler

Averaging with a list

Practice
•Write a program to instruct the user to input several 
numbers and calculate their average using list methods
Practice
•The header of an email takes the following format:
From professor.xman@uct.edu Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008
For a given email header, write a program to find out the domain of 
email address, and the month in which this email is sent
The double split pattern
•Sometimes we split a line one way, and then grab one piece of the 
line and split it again
From professor.xman@ uct.edu Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008


Tuples are more efficient
•Since Python doe snot have to build tuple structures to be 
modifiable, they are simpler and more efficient in terms of 
memory use and performance than lists
•In our program when we are making “temporary variables” 
we prefer tuples over lists
Tuples and dictionaries
•The item() method in 
dictionaries returns a 
list of (key, value) 
tuples

Tuples are comparable
•The comparison operators work with tuples and other sequences if 
the first item is equal . Python goes on to the next element, until it 
finds the elements which are different

Using sorted()
•We can also do this 
using a built -in function 
sorted() which takes a 
sequence as a 
parameter and returns 
a sorted sequence

Practice
•Write a program, which sorts the elements of a 
dictionary by the value of each element 
Sort by values instead of key
•If we could construct a 
list of tuples of the form 
(key, value) we could sort
by value
•We do this with a for 
loop that creates a list of 
tuples

Example: Finding the 10 most common words 
in a file


List v.s. dictionary
•Dictionaries are similar to lists, except that they use keys instead of 
numbers to look up values

Counting with a dictionary
•A common use of dictionary is counting how often we “see” 
something

Dictionary tracebacks
•It is an error to reference a key which is not in the dictionary
•We can use the inoperator to see if a key is in the dictionary

Practice
•Write a program to instruct the user to continuously input 
some words, and use dictionary to count how many times a 
word has been inputted before. 
The get() method 
•This pattern of checking to see if a keyis already in a dictionary, and 
assuming a default value if the key is not there is so common, that 
there is a method called get() that does this for us

Practice
•Write a program to instruct the user to input a line of texts, and use 
dictionary to count how many times a word has been seen in this line. 
You should use the get() method in this program.  
Definite loops and dictionaries
•Even though dictionaries are not stored in order , we can write a for 
loop that goes through all elements in a dictionary –actually it goes 
through all the keys in that dictionary and looks up the values

Retrieving lists of keys and values
•You can get a list of 
keys , values or items
(both) from a 
dictionary

Bonus: two iteration variables
•We loop through the 
key-value pairs in a 
dictionary using two
iteration variables
•Each iteration, the first 
variable is the key, and 
the second variable is 
the corresponding 
value for the key
Question:
Which statement will cause an error? 
•A. my_list = [1,2]; my_list.app end(1)
•B. my_ list= [1,2]; my_list [0]=2
•C. my_tuple = (1,2); my_tuple [0] = 3
•D. my_dict = {'a':1}; my_dict ['b'] = 2
Question:
Which of the following code segments will execute without raising an 
error? 
A.d = {"name": "Alice"}; print(d["age"])
B.s = [1, 2]; s.append (2)
C.result = "hello" + ["world"]
D.my_list = [1]; my_list.append ([1])
E.val= int(" abc")

Practice
•Write a program to open a file and count how many 
lines are included in this file
Reading the whole file
•We can read the whole file into a single string

Searching through a file
•We can put an if statement in the for loop to print the lines which 
satisfy certain conditions

Writing to a file
•To write a file, use the open() function with ‘ w’ argument
•Use the write() method to write to the file

Example: The factorial function
•The factorial of a positive integer n, denoted n!, is defined as follows:

The recursive definition of 
factorial function
•The factorial function can be naturally defined in a recursive way, for 
example, 5! = 5 · (4 ·  3 ·  2 ·  1) = 5 ·  4!
•More generally, for a positive integer n, we can define n! to be n ·  
(n−1)!
•Therefore, the recursive definition of factorial function is:

Solution
What does the `factorial(4)` call return?
The same function fact is called multiple 
times, each time solving a simpler 
problem
All the frames share the same parent -
only difference is the argument
What n evaluates to depends upon the 
current environment
What is fact(3)?
What is fact(2)?
What is fact(1)?
What is fact(0)?

The strategy of binary search
•We call an element of the sequence a candidate if, at the current 
stage of the search, we cannot rule out that this item matches the 
target
•The algorithm maintains two parameters, lowand high , such that all 
the candidate entries have index at least lowand at most high
•Initially, low = 0 and high = n−1 . We then compare the target value to 
the median candidate, that is, the item data[mid] with index
mid = (low+high)/2
The strategy of binary search
•If the target equals data[mid] , then we have found the item we 
are looking for, and the search terminates successfully
•If target < data[mid], then we recur on the first half of the 
sequence, that is, on the interval of indices from low to mid−1
•If target > data[mid], then we recur on the second half of the 
sequence, that is, on the interval of indices from mid+1 to high
Solution

Practice: Power function
•Write a program to calculate the power function 𝑓𝑥,𝑛=
𝑥𝑛using Recursion.

A better recursive definition of power 
function

Solution:

Example: Drawing an English ruler
•We denote the length of the tick 
designating a whole inch as the 
major tick length . 
•Between the marks for whole 
inches, the ruler contains a series 
of minor ticks , placed at intervals 
of 1/2 inch, 1/4 inch, and so on. 
•As the size of the interval 
decreases by half, the tick length 
decreases by one
Recursive implementation of English 
ruler
•An interval with a central tick length L ≥ 1 is 
composed of:
An interval with a central tick length L−1
A single tick of length L
An interval with a central tick length L−1
Solution

The recursive 
trace for 
English ruler

Linear Recursion
•If a recursive function is designed so that each invocation of 
the body makes at most one new recursive call, this is know n
as linear recursion
•Finding the smallest number and binary search are both 
linear recursive algorithms
Linear Recursion

Practice: Sum of a list
•Given a list of numbers, write a program to calculate 
the sum of this list using recursion
Solution:

Multiple recursion
•When a function makes two or more recursive calls, 
we say that it uses multiple recursion
•Drawing the English ruler is a multiple recursion 
program
Multiple recursion
•When a function makes two or more recursive calls, 
we say that it uses multiple recursion
•Drawing the English ruler is a multiple recursion 
program

Practice: Binary sum
•Write a function binarySum() to calculate the sum of a 
list of numbers. Inside binarySum() two recursive calls 
should be made
