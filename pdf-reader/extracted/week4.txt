Stored (and reused) steps
Program
 Output
This reusable paragraph of code is usually called function
Python functions
•There are two types of functions in Python
Built -in functions which are part of Python, such as print(), int(), 
float(), etc
Functions that we define ourselves and then use
•The names of built -in functions are usually considered 
as new reserved words , i.e. we do not use them as 
variable names
Function definition
•In Python, a function is some reusable code which can take 
arguments as input, perform some computations, and then output 
some results
•Functions are defined using reserved word def
•We call/invoke a function by using the function name, parenthesis 
and arguments in an expression
Argument
Result

Keypoints
def<name>(<parameters> ):
return<return expression>Function signature indicates name and number of 
arguments
Function bodydefines the 
computation
performed when the function is 
applieddefsquare(x):
returnx * x
y =square(-2)
Execution rule for def Statements
1.Create a function with signature <name>(<parameters> )
2.Set the body of that function to be everything indented after the first 
line
3.Bind <name>to that function in the current frameDemo
Building our own functions
•We create a new function using the defkey word, followed by 
optional parameters in parenthesis
•defstatements are a type of assignment that bind names 
to function values
•We indent the body of the function
•This defines the function, but does not execute the body of the 
function

Parameters
•A parameter is a variable
which we use in the function 
definition that is a ‘ handle ’ 
that allows the code in the 
function to access the 
arguments for a particular
function invocation

Argument
•An argument is a value we pass into the 
function as its input when we callthe 
function
•We use arguments so we can direct the 
function to do different kinds of work 
when we call it at different times
•We put the argument in parenthesis after 
the name of the function
argument

Return values
Program Output•Often a function will take its arguments , do some computation and 
return a value to be used as the value of the function call in the 
calling expression. The return keyword is for this purpose. 
Return values
•A fruitful function is one that 
produces a result (or return 
value )
•The return statement ends the 
function execution and ‘sends 
back’ the result of the function

Argument, parameter, and result

Multiple parameters/arguments
•We can define more than one 
parameter in a function 
definition
•We simply add more arguments 
when we callthe function
•We match the number and order
of arguments and parameters

Void functions
•When a function does not return a value, it is called a “ void ” function
•Functions that return values are “fruitful” functions ( 有返回值函数 )
•Void functions ( 无返回值函数 ) are “not fruitful ” 
Functions without return
•When a function has 
no return statement , 
it will return None
Scope of variables
•The scope of a variable is the 
part of program where this 
variable can be accessed
•A variable created inside a 
function is referred to as a 
local variable
•Global variables are created 
outside all functions and are 
accessible to all functions in 
their scope

Scope of variables
•Different variables may 
share a name if they have 
different scopes

Global variable
•In a function, you can use keyword 
global to specify that a variable is a 
global variable
•Be very careful when define and 
use global variable

Default argument
•Python allows you to define functions with default argument values
•The default argument values will be passed to the function, when it is 
invoked without arguments
Return multiple values
•Python allows a function to 
return multiple values
•The sort function returns two 
values; when it is invoked, you 
need to pass the returned 
values in a simultaneous 
assignment

To function or not function…
•Organize your code into paragraphs -capture a complete thought and 
name it
•Don’t repeat yourself –name it to work once and reuse it
•If something goes too complex, break up them into several blocks, 
and put each of them into a function
•Make a library of common stuffs that you do over and over again –
perhaps share with other people
Practice
•Write a function to instruct the user to input the working 
hours and hourly rate, and then return the salary. If the 
working hours exceed 40 hours, then the extra hours 
received 1.5 times pay. 
Practice
•Write a function to find and return the largest number in a 
list, such as
[5, 8, 2, 9, 3 ]
[-4, -1, -7, -2]
[100, 250, 175, 300]
Do not use the max function.

•Loop and counting
•Slicing strings
•Conditional statement 
•String library and functions
•File processing
•Opening files
•File processing
•Searching through a file
•Writing to a file
String type
•A string is a sequence of characters
•A string literal uses quotes ‘’ or “”
•For strings, + means “ concatenate ”
•When a string contains numbers, it is still a string
•We can convert numbers in a string into a number using int() or float()
Reading and converting
•We prefer to read data in using strings and then parse and convert 
the data as we need
•This gives us more control over error situations and/or bad user 
inputs
•Raw input numbers must be converted from strings
Looking inside strings
•We can get any character in a string 
using an index specified in square 
brackets
•The index value must be an integer
which starts from zero
•The index value can be an expression

Index out of range
•You will get an Python 
error if you attempt to 
index beyond the end of 
a string
•Be careful when 
specifying an index value 

Strings have length
•There is a built -in function 
len() which gives us the length
of a string

Len() function

Looping through strings
•Using a for 
statement, we can 
easily loop 
through each 
character in a 
string
•String is 
essentially a listin 
Python

Practice
•Write a program to use a while statement together 
with len() function to loop through a given string
Loop and counting
•This is a simple 
statement that loops 
through each letter in 
a string and counts 
the number of times 
the loop encounters 
the ‘a’ character

Look deeper into in
•The iteration variables “iterates” 
through the sequence (ordered set)
•The block (body) of the loop is 
executed once for each value in the 
sequence
•The iteration variable moves through 
all the values in the sequence

•The iteration variable loops through the string, and the body of the 
loop  is executed once for each character in that string

Slicing strings
•We can also look at any continuous 
section of a string using colon
operator
•The second number is one beyond 
the end of the slice –i.e. “ up to but 
not including ”
•If the second number is beyond the 
length of the string, it stops at the 
end

Slicing strings
•If we leave off the first 
or second number of 
the slice, it is assumed 
to be the beginning or 
end of the string 
respectively

Using ‘in’ in conditional statement
•The inkeyword can also be 
used to check whether one 
string is in another string
•The inexpression is a logical 
expression and returns True or 
False
•It can be used in if or while
statement

String library
•Python has a number of string 
functions which are in the string 
library
•These functions are built -into every 
string, we invoke them by 
appending the function to the 
string variable
•These function do not modify the 
original string, instead they return a 
new string altered from the original 
string

https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string -methods


Searching a string
•We can use the find() function 
to search for a substring in a 
string
•find() finds the first occurrence 
of the target sub -string
•If the sub -string is not found, it 
returns -1
•Important: the string position 
starts from 0

Making everything upper or lower 
case
•You can convert a string 
into upper case or lower 
case
•Hint: often when we use 
find() to find a substring, 
we convert the original 
string into lower case 
first, so that we don’t 
need to worry about 
case

Search and replace
•The replace() function is 
like a “search and 
replace” operation in a 
word processor
•It replaces all 
occurrences of the 
search string with the 
replacement string

Stripping whitespace
•Sometimes we want to take a 
string and remove whitespaces
at the beginning and/or end
•lstrip () and rstrip () to the left 
and right only
•Strip() removes both beginning 
and ending whitespaces

Prefixes
•startswith ()function 
checks whether a string is 
starting with a given 
string

Example

File processing
•A text file can be thought of as a sequence of lines

Opening files
•Before we can read the contents of a file, we must tell Python which 
file we are going to work with and what we will do with that file
•This is done with the open() function
•Open() returns a “ file handle ”  -a variable used to perform operations 
on files 
•Kind of like “File -> Open” in a word processor
Using open()
•handle = open (filename , mode )
•Returns a handle used to manipulate the file
•Filename is a string
•Mode is optional, use ‘r’ if we want to read the file, and ‘w’ if we 
want to write to the file
Handle

When files are missing

The newline character
•We use a new character to indicate 
when a line ends called “ newline ”
•We represent it as ‘ \n’ in strings 
•Newline is still one character, not 
two

File processing
•A text file can be thought of as a sequence of lines
•A text file has newline at the end of each line

File handle as a sequence
•A file handle open for read can 
be treated as a sequence of 
strings where each line in the file 
is a string in the sequence
•We can use the forstatement to 
loop through a sequence

Practice
•Write a program to open a file and count how many 
lines are included in this file
Reading the whole file
•We can read the whole file into a single string

Searching through a file
•We can put an if statement in the for loop to print the lines which 
satisfy certain conditions

Writing to a file
•To write a file, use the open() function with ‘ w’ argument
•Use the write() method to write to the file
